# Tunnel⚡️Sats Setup Tool

The `tunnelsats.sh` script is the new, unified setup tool for TunnelSats v2. It consolidates all previous scripts (`setupv2.sh`, `uninstallv2.sh`, `tunnelsats-sub-details.sh`) into a single, robust interface.

## Usage

Run the script with `sudo` and one of the following commands:

```bash
sudo bash tunnelsats.sh [install|uninstall|status|restart|pre-check]
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`install`** | Interactive wizard to install WireGuard, configure your node (LND/CLN/LIT), and set up networking. |
| **`uninstall`** | "Nuclear" uninstall. Removes all TunnelSats configurations, restores backups, and cleans up Docker networks/firewalls. |
| **`status`** | Detailed diagnostics. Checks subscription validity, interface status, Docker health, and connectivity (Ping/RTT). |
| **`restart`** | Smart restart helper. Re-initializes the WireGuard interface and DNS watchdog if you lose connection. |
| **`pre-check`** | Non-invasive verification. Checks if your system has the necessary prerequisites (WireGuard, Docker, etc.) without making changes. |

## Compatibility & Testing Status

We are iteratively validating `tunnelsats.sh` across various Node OS platforms. The following table reflects the current **Verified** state.

| Hardware/Platform | Node OS | OS Version | [i]nstall | [u]ninstall | [s]tatus | [r]estart |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Raspberry Pi 4 | **Umbrel** | umbrelOS 1.5 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Raspberry Pi | **RaspiBlitz** | v1.11.x | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Proxmox VM | **Umbrel** | v1.2.1 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| PC / VPS | **Bare Metal** | Debian 12 / Ubuntu | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Pi / PC (x86) | **myNode** | v0.3.x | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Any | **Start9** | Any | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**Legend:**
- ✅ **Verified**: Tested and working 100%.
- ⚠️ **Experimental**: Logic exists (ported from v2), but needs live verification.
- ❓ **Untested**: Not yet validated on this specific environment.
- ❌ **Not Supported**: Current architecture is incompatible with script installation.

> **Bare Metal / MiniBolt Note:**
> We have explicitly verified the setup on **[MiniBolt](https://github.com/MiniBoltGuide/minibolt)** (Ubuntu/Debian) environments. If following the MiniBolt guide, this script respects the standard directory structure and user permissions.

## Legacy Version / Troubleshooting

If you encounter critical issues with `tunnelsats.sh` (v3.0), you can fall back to the proven v2 scripts located in the `archive/` folder.

**To use the legacy version:**
```bash
cd archive
sudo bash setupv2.sh
```

These scripts (`setupv2.sh`, `uninstallv2.sh`, etc.) are preserved for compatibility but will strictly be in maintenance mode. Please report any v3 issues so we can fix them!
